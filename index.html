									<b>What's the Issue?</b> </br>
									• Unfathomable masses of valuable scientific data lie hidden in the collections of libraries and archives:
									lukring in the unprocessed boxes of grey literature, hand-written field notebooks, and unpublished papers of researchers
									that accumlate in storage as scientists retire, labs close, and projects end.<br>
									<b>This research investigates:</b> </br>
									• The challenges and opportunities of recovering and resusing historical or defunct data for active and ongoing scientific research</br>
									• The value and requirements of data resources</br>
									• The conceptual and pragmatic relationships among ata recovery and reuse efforts in various disciplines, domains, and organizational contexts</br>
									• What data curators can learn from scientific and scholarly information practices, toward promiting use and reuse of collection</br>
									</br>
									<b>How?</b> </br>
									• Through interviews with experts who have conducted "data rescue" missions and successfully reused "defunct" data in novel integrative and 
									longitundal studies, our research aims to help scientists and curators realize that the full potential value of the collecitons they have, and 
									mitigate the loss of irreplacable evidence for advancing knowledge across disciplines </br>
									<b>Outcomes:</b> </br>
									This project began as part of the National Agricultural Library Digital Curation Fellows program. Under the auspices of that program, the project produced: </br>
									• iConference Paper</br>
									• Poster</br>
									• White Paper</br>

								<b>What's the Issue?</b> </br>
								• While various policy interventions and technical developments have advances the practices and impact
								of digital stewardship, sustainability continues to be a systemic problem for digital scholarship. 
								<br>
								• The least tractable challenge to sustaining digital schoalrship continues to be the most essential: 
								many digital humanities resources and digital community archives resist institutional collection due 
								to the depth of ongoing investment and control that communities wish to retain over the resources
								they have created.
								</br>
								<b>Why?</b> </br>
								• Outside of exceptionally well-resourced digital humanities centers and libraries, 
								community-driven digital collections and databases lack systemic support. Digital humanities collections 
								and digital community archives tend to be created and maintained by small, collaborative teams of community members, 
								researchers, and technologists, often without ongoing assistance from curation institutions. </br>
								• The prevailing paradigm—of library, museum, or archive stewardship of digital collections—struggles to 
								accommodate the diversity, complexity, and community-centeredness of digital humanities scholarship and 
								digital community archives.

								<b>Conduct Compratative Case Studies to:</b><br>
								• Produce and evaaluate a preliminary framework of community-centered sustainability strategies <br>
								• Understand how collections and communities mutually contribute to one another's long-term sustainability <br>
								• Articulate sustainability requirements for diverse projects in a range of contexts <br>
								• Identify contextual factors that affect sustainability of collections and other resources <br>
								• Choose and implement stragies to increase sustainability of digital collection
				
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Investigate Sociotechnical Workflows to:</b><br>
								• Identify how workflows facilitate or compromise ongoing collection development and maintenance, and ultiamte durability <br>
								• Identify how these workflows can effectively center collection constituencies <br>
								• Refine models for equitable partnership among cultural institutions and communities <br>
								• Identify roles that cultural instiutions may play to support community-determined and community-led sustainability strategies
